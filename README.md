 ## Understand Basic concepts of angular using services to manage data in application.
 Services play crucial role in  **passing data from one components to another**. As a result of which there is only one way to manipulate the data within the application. Services also  _help data communication in two ways from parent to child component and vice versa._  One of the main important think to remember while using the services is they **_should be injected using @Injectable() decorator_**. 
Various other basic features like **_Directives, Component life cycle, Routing, AuthGuard, Observables, Forms and Inbuilt angular features like HttpService, Pipes_** are also covered. 

Hope it will clear the concepts :smiley:
